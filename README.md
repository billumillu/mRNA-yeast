# Quantification of mRNA Levels in Yeast

## Repository Overview
Welcome to my GitHub profile! This repository showcases my work on quantifying mRNA levels in yeast cells using smFISH images. By developing an advanced pipeline and employing machine learning techniques, I have aimed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of mRNA quantification processes.

## Project Highlights
**Abstract:** In this project, I developed a specialized pipeline using FISH-quant's Big-FISH package for Python to accurately quantify mRNA levels in yeast cells. The pipeline addresses the manual user input requirement for threshold determination, making it more efficient and user-friendly. Additionally, I conducted analysis on mRNA production and compared gene expression using statistical tests.

**Introduction:** Yeast cells provide a valuable system for studying biological cycles and metabolic disorders. To facilitate research in this area, I have focused on improving existing pipelines for mRNA quantification in smFISH images of yeast cells. The goal is to develop efficient and user-friendly solutions that require minimal input from the user while delivering meaningful results.

**Conclusion:** My project successfully enhanced the quantification pipeline for mRNA levels in yeast cells. Notably, I improved spot detection by analyzing images individually, leading to more accurate results. Additionally, I addressed the issue of manual threshold determination by implementing two approaches: calculation based on image features and prediction using machine learning models. The pipeline now offers automated and reliable quantification of mRNA levels in smFISH images.

**Discussion:** This project opens up opportunities for further improvements and extensions. Some potential areas of focus include enhancing the machine learning model, evaluating spot detection performance, testing the pipeline on different genes or organisms, supporting various file formats, and exploring the application of the pipeline in different phases of the yeast metabolic cycle.
